# API Security

API security is the protection of the integrity of APIsâ€”both owned and in-use API services. APIs are one of the most common ways that microservices and containers communicate including systems and associated applications. As integration and interconnectivity become more important, APIs play a vital part in the security of these microservices.

In this section, we will include content that will reflect best security practices including but not limited to the following content:

* _API Security Checklist_
* _API Security Assessment Tools_
  * _Summary and Usage of these Tools_
* _API Common Vulnerability Blocks_

I will try my best to update each of these sections with the latest updates and references, on the best opportunities as possible.
