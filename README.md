# Introduction

## About

This is a Wiki that will serve as an educational, research and reference guide relating to topics I have learnt during my educational and professional career in Computer Science, primarily specialising in Cyber Security. I have also decided to include miscellaneous content about other technical findings or issues and associated solutions, I've collated over time, so I am able to reference these at any point in time in the future.

Some of the major topics I plan to section out in this Wiki consist of but are not limited to Red Teaming, Purple Teaming, Penetration Testing, Application Security and associated branches of Technical Security to name a few and to keep the list non-exhaustive.

I will make my best attempt to make this as sectioned out and as accurate as possible with the latest techniques and updates. The 'Search' functionality on this GitBook can help quickly search for areas you are interested in.
