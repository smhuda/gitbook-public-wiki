* Open the file containing the IP addresses in [SublimeText](https://www.sublimetext.com/) and go to `Find - Replace...`.
* Make sure you have the RegEx selector enabled - it looks like a `.*` sign next to the search field.
* For IP addresses that look like this: `99.7.83.38` enter the following regex: `\b(\d{1,3}\.){3}\d{1,3}\b`.
* For IP addresses that look like this: `99.61.204.91/32` enter the following regex: `\b(\d{1,3}\.){3}\d{1,3}\/\d+\b`
* Then click the `Find All` button (on the right) and copy them into a single blacklist of IP addresses.
* After that you can leave only unique values. To do this, open the menu `Edit - Permute Lines - Unique`. Depending on the length of the list it may take a few seconds or minutes.
* Save the file and use it for your needs.
