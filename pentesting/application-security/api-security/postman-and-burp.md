# Postman and Burp

## Error in Postman Connecting/Proxying via Burp Suite:

Burp will only send HTTP/2 requests if it has been told by the server that HTTP/2 is supported. After setting the configuration in proxy options to allow only HTTP1.1, the both API requests behaved as expected.

## How to Proxy via Burp Using Postman:

Ensure `SSL Verification` is toggled `Off` in Postman Settings as follows:

Set the Postman proxy Settings where `System Proxy` is off and `Proxy Settings` are set to the Burp Proxy. In my case it is `127.0.0.1` and `8080` as LPORT.
