# Measure Response Time using CURL

**Option 1:** to measure `total time`:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
curl -o /dev/null -s -w 'Total: %{time_total}s\n'  https://www.google.com
```
{% endcode %}

Sample output:

```bash
Total: 0.441094s
```

**Option 2:** to get `time to establish connection`, `time to first byte (TTFB)` and `total time`:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
curl -o /dev/null -s -w 'Establish Connection: %{time_connect}s\nTTFB: %{time_starttransfer}s\nTotal: %{time_total}s\n'  https://www.google.com
```
{% endcode %}

Sample output:

```bash
Establish Connection: 0.020033s
TTFB: 0.417907s
Total: 0.435486s
```
