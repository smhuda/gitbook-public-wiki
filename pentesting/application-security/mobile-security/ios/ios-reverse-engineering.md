## `ipa` package analysis

`ipa` is essentially a `zip` file.

## `ipa` file root structures

* `iTunes Artwork`--a PNG app icon for showing in iTunes and the App Store.
* `iTunesMetadata.plist`â€”Contains copyright information, release date, purchase date, name of the developer and company who created it, etc.
* `/Payload/Application.app`

> To repack the `ipa`, simple select the three files and folder listed above and right click and select compress. The `Archive.zip` you get can be install using `ideviceinstaller`. You can also rename the file name you wanted.

> You can also use script.

```
cd <the-directory-that-store-the-three-files-and-folder>
zip -0 -y -r out.ipa .
#or use
zip -0  --symlinks --recurse-paths out.ipa .
# the `out.ipa` is the result
```
