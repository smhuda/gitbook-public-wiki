# iOS Jailbreak Bypass

## Liberty Lite

Liberty Lite is a jailbreak bypass tweak that can be used for lots of different apps. It works for many, but not all, of the banking apps listed above that have jailbreak detection.

1. Open Cydia on your jailbroken device and tap the ‘Sources’ menu at the bottom.
2. At the top, tap ‘+’ to add a new repo. In the text box, type [`https://ryleyangus.com/rep`](https://ryleyangus.com/repo%E2%80%99)then tap ‘Add Source’.
3. Once the repo has been added, tap on it in the sources list and select ‘All Catagories’. In the list, you should see ‘Liberty Lite \(Beta\)’.
4. Tap on Liberty Lite \(Beta\), ‘Get’ then ‘Queue’ followed by ‘Confirm’ to install the tweak. Once installed, you will need to respring your device for it to start working.
5. Open the Settings app and scroll down to the Liberty Lite menu. In here tap ‘Block Jailbreak Detection’, then toggle it on for the app\(s\) that have jailbreak detection.
6. Close the app in the app switcher if you opened it before turning Liberty Lite on for it.
7. If the bypass works, those app\(s\) should now be usable.

## **SanTanDick**

The Santander mobile banking app is a little bit more tricky to bypass than most others. Not only does this require an app-specific tweak to be installed, but it also requires an older version of the app.

1. Open Sileo/Cydia on your jailbroken device and tap the ‘Sources’ menu at the bottom.
2. At the top, tap ‘+’ to add a new repo. In the text box, type [`https://test.unlimapps.com`](https://test.unlimapps.com) then tap ‘Add Source’.
3. Once the repo has been added, tap on it in the sources list and select ‘All Catagories’. In the list, you should see ‘App Admin’.
4. Tap on App Admin, ‘Get’ then ‘Queue’ followed by ‘Confirm’ to install the tweak. Once installed, you will need to respring your device for it to start working.
5. Open the App Store and navigate to the Santander Mobile Banking app page. Tap and hold on the ‘Get’ or ‘Open’ button to activate App Admin. When the menu appears, tap ‘Downgrade’.
6. From the list of app versions shown, select ‘4.1.0’. There will be two with this version number and either of them will work. This will downgrade the app to version 4.1.0.
7. Open Sileo/Cydia again and tap the ‘Search’ menu at the bottom.
8. In the search box type ‘Filza File Manager’. Select the first option with a matching name and tap ‘Get’ to queue it for install.
9. Tap the ‘Sources’ menu at the bottom, then at the top, tap ‘+’ to add a new repo. In the text box, type [`https://repo.sparkes.zone`](https://repo.sparkes.zone)then tap ‘Add Source’.
10. Once the repo has been added, tap on it in the sources list and select ‘All Catagories’. In the list, you should see ‘SanTanDick’.
11. Tap on SanTanDick, ‘Get’ then ‘Queue’ followed by ‘Confirm’ to install the tweak and Filza File Manager. Once installed, you will need to respring your device for it to start working.
12. Before the bypass tweak will start working, you need to edit a file in the Santander app. Open the new Filza app and press the back button until it shows ‘/’ at the top.
13. Navigate to `/var/containers/Bundle/Application/Santander/Santander.app`. In here find the `Info.plist` file and tap on it.
14. Tap the ‘Root’ line to expand it. Find the line called `CFBundleShortVersionString` and tap the ⓘ symbol.
15. Change the number in the ‘Value’ text box to `999.999.999`. Tap the back button then ‘Save’ to save the change. This change will allow the bypass tweak to work, and prevent updates from showing in the App Store.
16. You should now be able to use the Santander Mobile Banking app on your jailbroken device!

## **MetroWank**

Metro Bank is a fairly easy jailbreak detection to bypass, but it does require an app-specific tweak to do it.

1. Open Sileo/Cydia on your jailbroken device and tap the ‘Sources’ menu at the bottom.
2. At the top, tap ‘+’ to add a new repo. In the text box, type [`https://repo.sparkes.zone`](https://repo.sparkes.zone) then tap ‘Add Source’.
3. Once the repo has been added, tap on it in the sources list and select ‘All Catagories’. In the list, you should see ‘MetroWank’.
4. Tap on MetroWank, ‘Get’ then ‘Queue’ followed by ‘Confirm’ to install the tweak. Once installed, you will need to respring your device for it to start working.
5. You should now be able to use the Metro Bank app on your jailbroken device!
