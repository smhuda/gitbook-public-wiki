* [ ] &#x20;[Biometric authentication, if any, is not event-bound (i.e. using an API that simply returns "true" or "false"). Instead, it is based on unlocking the Keystore.](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/blob/master/Document/0x05f-Testing-Local-Authentication.md#testing-biometric-authentication-mstg-auth-8)
