# BurpSuite

## Adding all Subdomains of a Domain in the Scope

Burp's scope rules use regular expressions in the host field, so you can create a rule that matches something like:

<mark style="color:red;">**Scope --> Advanced Scope**</mark>

```
.*\.test\.com$
```

## If a website has multiple domain names like test.in and test.com, how to add all of them to the scope?

```
.*\.test\.*$
```

```
(^|^[^:]+://|[^.]+.)test.*
```

**https://regexr.com/ is a great resource too.**
